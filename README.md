# Plotly
## My clients Basil and Sadhana wanted me to creat an earthquake map to create map track earthquakes in different parts of the world.
## With the use of Python and Mapbox API I was able to create exactly what they were asking for.

## They like how I created the my earthquake map with 2 different maps and the earthquake overly. However, they also wanted me to create a map with earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map. I was able to use the same information I used with the previous maps I created to to it.
